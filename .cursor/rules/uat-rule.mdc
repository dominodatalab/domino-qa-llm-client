## Recommended Test Sequence

### For Complete Platform Assessment:
1. **Start**: `run_master_comprehensive_uat_suite(user_name, project_name, include_performance=True)`
2. **Review results** - Check pass rates and error details
3. **Clean up**: `cleanup_test_resources(user_name)`

### For Specific Issue Investigation:
1. **Authentication issues**: `test_user_authentication` → `test_project_operations`
2. **Performance problems**: `performance_test_concurrent_jobs` → `performance_test_data_upload_throughput`
3. **Dataset issues**: `enhanced_test_dataset_operations`
4. **Job execution problems**: `enhanced_test_advanced_job_operations`

### For Different User Types:
- **System Administrators**: `run_admin_uat_suite`
- **Data Scientists**: `run_user_uat_suite`
- **Platform Managers**: `run_comprehensive_split_uat_suite`

## Parameters Required
- **user_name**: Domino username (required for all tests)
- **project_name**: Project name (use test project names like "uat_test_project")
- **include_performance**: Boolean for performance tests (default: true)
- **collaborator_email**: Optional for collaboration testing
- **concurrent_count**: Number of concurrent operations for performance tests
- **hardware_tier**: Hardware tier for job testing (small/medium/large)

## Error Handling
- **Permission errors**: User may lack required permissions - check API key and user roles
- **API errors**: Check API key validity and DOMINO_HOST configuration
- **Timeout errors**: Jobs/workspaces may need more time - platform may be under load
- **Resource limit errors**: Platform capacity may be reached during performance tests
- **Connection errors**: Verify DOMINO_HOST URL format and network connectivity

## Interpreting Results
- **PASSED**: Feature is working correctly
- **FAILED**: Feature has issues - examine error details in response
- **Performance metrics**: Compare against established baselines
- **Pass rate < 100%**: Indicates system issues requiring investigation
- **Cleanup status**: Verify test resources were properly removed

## Safety Guidelines
- **NEVER run UAT tests in production projects** - always use test project names
- **Use test project prefixes**: "uat_", "test_", "qa_" for easy identification
- **Monitor resource usage**: Performance tests can consume significant platform resources
- **Clean up after testing**: Always run `cleanup_test_resources` when done
- **Test in non-peak hours**: Minimize impact on production users
- **Limit concurrent tests**: Don't run multiple performance test suites simultaneously
