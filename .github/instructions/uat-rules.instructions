## Domino QA UAT - Lean Rules

- Always read `domino_project_settings.md` for `USER_NAME`, `PROJECT_NAME`, or  the user will provide:
- `user_name`: Domino username (must have admin access)
- `project_name`: Test project name (e.g., "uat_test_project")

## End-to-End UAT Protocol

**MANDATORY: When user requests "end to end UAT" or "comprehensive UAT":**

**CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS - DO NOT DEVIATE:**
1. **MUST execute ALL 14 test functions in the exact sequence listed below**
2. **MUST run continuously without stopping, pausing, or waiting for user feedback between tests**
3. **MUST NOT ask for approval or confirmation before proceeding to the next test**
4. **MUST complete all 14 tests before reporting final results**
5. **MUST show progress immediately after each test completes**
6. **MUST display operations from each test result**
7. **MUST build summary table at the end after all 14 tests complete**

**EXECUTION RULES:**
- Start with test #1 and proceed sequentially through test #14
- After each test completes, immediately proceed to the next test
- Do NOT wait for user input between tests
- Do NOT pause for confirmation
- Do NOT stop after any test (even if it fails)
- Continue automatically until all 14 tests are executed
- Only after completing all 14 tests, run cleanup operations
- Only after cleanup, provide the final summary

**EXPLICIT PROHIBITIONS - DO NOT:**
- ❌ DO NOT stop after test #4 or any other test number
- ❌ DO NOT ask "Should I continue?" or "Proceed with next test?"
- ❌ DO NOT wait for user approval between tests
- ❌ DO NOT pause execution for any reason
- ❌ DO NOT report "partial completion" - only report after ALL 14 tests
- ❌ DO NOT skip any test in the sequence
- ✅ DO execute all 14 tests automatically in one continuous run



**MANDATORY TEST SEQUENCE - EXECUTE ALL 14 TESTS IN THIS EXACT ORDER:**

**YOU MUST CALL ALL OF THESE FUNCTIONS IN SEQUENCE WITHOUT STOPPING:**

1. `test_post_upgrade_env_rebuild` - Environment build
2. `test_file_management_operations` - File operations
3. `test_file_version_reversion` - File version reversion
4. `test_project_copying` - Project copying
5. `test_project_forking` - Project forking
6. `test_advanced_job_operations` - Job operations
7. `test_job_scheduling` - Job scheduling
8. `test_comprehensive_ide_workspace_suite` - Workspace IDEs
9. `test_workspace_file_sync` - Workspace file sync
10. `test_workspace_hardware_tiers` - Hardware tiers
11. `enhanced_test_dataset_operations` - Dataset operations
12. `test_model_api_publish` - Model API publish
13. `test_app_publish` - App publish
14. `run_admin_portal_uat_suite` - Admin portal

**AFTER ALL 14 TESTS COMPLETE, THEN:**
- Run `cleanup_all_project_workspaces(user_name, project_name)`
- Run `cleanup_all_project_datasets(user_name, project_name)`
- Generate final summary table

**Progress format:**
```
Test X/14: Test Name — ✅ PASSED
   Operation: ✅ PASSED
```

## Workspace Testing
- List which IDEs are being tested
- Test at least 2 different IDEs
- Stop and delete all workspaces after testing

## Cleanup
**MANDATORY: Always run cleanup AFTER all 14 tests complete (not during or between tests):**
```
cleanup_all_project_workspaces(user_name, project_name)
cleanup_all_project_datasets(user_name, project_name)
```
**Note:** Cleanup happens ONLY after test #14 completes, not before or during the test sequence.

## Safety
- Never run UAT in production projects
- Use test project names only (e.g., "uat_test_project")
- User must have admin permissions
